# Python-NumPy
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, Fourier transform, and matrices. In Python, we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process. NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy. Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important. NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
Here are some things that you can do with Numpy:
Perform mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

Work with high-performance multidimensional array objects.

Use it as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.

Perform mathematical functions used widely in scientific computing fast and easy to use.

Work with arrays in the domain of linear algebra, Fourier transform, and matrices.
